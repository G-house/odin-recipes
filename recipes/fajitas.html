    <h2>Best Weeknight Award Goes To:</h2>
    <p>Sheet pan chicken fajitas! Thank you for being there when I only have the energy to do slightly more than open a bag of orange chicken. Chop up some onions, peppers, and chicken. Throw on some spices and toss it in the oven while your chasing kids around the kitchen. 30 minutes later you have a delicious meal that tastes like it spent much more time and effort than it did.</p>
